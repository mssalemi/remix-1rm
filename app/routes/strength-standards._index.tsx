          Step into the strength city â€“ where we're serious about lifting, but
          not so serious that we won't crack a joke or two. Our strength
          benchmarks are not your average fitness targets; think of them as
          friendly nudges, urging you to surpass what you thought were your
          limits.

          Our performance standards are not here to fuel an ego race but to
          spark the fire within you. We've got a nifty calculator to estimate
          your one-rep max because we believe in science, not sorcery. Age is
          just a number, and weight is just a measure â€“ your journey is uniquely
          yours.
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
          Remember, these standards are not about fitting into a mold; they're
          about breaking it and sculpting your own fitness narrative. So, lace
          up those sneakers, grab your water bottle, and let's turn those
          lifting dreams into reality. You're not just lifting weights; you're
          lifting your own standards. Cheers to the gains, the grins, and the
          glorious journey ahead! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
